excerpt: "Exploring whether true abundance could finally let us live by desire and natural aptitude — not survival."

As a teacher and a mother, I often tell people: do what you enjoy. You’re far more likely to succeed — and be happy — if the task lights you up. It’s a huge generalisation, of course, but as a starting point it’s not far off.

&nbsp;


**My movie example**

I’m a real fan of *Margin Call*.

Sam is a manager — a real manager of people, positions, and scenarios. His gift is pulling the right strings to make the machine run the way he wants.

Peter is the numbers guy (literally a rocket scientist) — the numbers speak to him.

John is the puppet master — he doesn’t manage the others; he decides what they will see and how the play ends.

None of these people could swap roles, not because they’re inadequate, but because they’re doing what fits their personalities and natural aptitudes best.

Imagine if we were all doing that — if people hadn’t chosen their work for security, income, or status.



&nbsp;


**Is it possible?**

If Elon Musk is correct and we’re heading toward abundance and a universal high income, then that’s all we’re left with: desire.

The forces that nudge (or force) us into roles we don’t love simply vanish.

&nbsp;

**The alternative**

We’ve all seen the films where parts of society have unlimited access to abundance, and it leads to shallow, hollow lives. The hero usually discovers that real happiness lies outside that excess.

But there’s one key difference: in those stories, the abundance is available only at the cost of others. It’s tainted by extortion, greed, and abuse.

&nbsp;

If Elon Musk is right — if AI really does open the door to true abundance — then we could be looking at a different world entirely:

_One driven not by excess or wallowing in it,  
but by freedom to follow passion._

&nbsp;

Perhaps we really can innovate our way to something better — heal the scars humanity has left on the earth, untangle the mangled mess we’re living through right now, and arrive at… well, something else.

&nbsp;

With love,
